    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful analysis of uranium-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas relies on the use of complex forward numerical models like dynamic melting (McKenzie, 1985) and equilibrium porous flow (Spiegelman and Elliott, 1993). Historically, such models have either been solved analytically for simplified scenarios, such as constant melting rate or constant solid/melt trace element partitioning throughout the melting process, or have relied on incremental or numerical calculators with limited power to solve problems and/or restricted availability. The most public numerical solution to reactive porous flow, UserCalc (Spiegelman, 2000) was maintained on a private institutional server for nearly two decades, but that approach has been unsustainable in light of modern security concerns. Here we present a more long-lasting solution to the problems of availability, model sophistication and flexibility, and long-term access in the form of a cloud-hosted, publicly available Jupyter notebook. Similar to UserCalc, the new notebook calculates U-series disequilibria during time-dependent, equilibrium partial melting in a one-dimensional porous flow regime where mass is conserved. In addition, we also provide a new disequilibrium transport model which has the same melt transport model as UserCalc, but approximates rate-limited diffusive exchange of nuclides between solid and melt using linear kinetics. The degree of disequilibrium during transport is controlled by a Damköhler number, allowing  the full spectrum of equilibration models from complete fractional melting ($Da=0$) to equilibrium transport ($Da=\\infty$).

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous forward melting models are necessary to interpret the origins of empirically-measured U-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas, but the limited and unreliable availability of reproducible tools for making such calculations remains a persistent problem for geochemists. To date, a number of models have been developed for this task, including classical dynamic melting after McKenzie (1985) and the reactive porous flow model of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). There have since been numerous approaches to using both the dynamic and porous flow models that range from simplified analytical solutions (e.g., Sims et al., 1999; Zou, 1998; Zou and Zindler, 2000) to incremental dynamic melting calculators (Stracke et al., 2003), two-porosity calculators (Jull et al., 2002; Lundstrom et al., 2000; Sims et al., 2002), and one-dimensional numerical solutions to reactive porous flow (Spiegelman, 2000) and dynamic melting (Bourdon et al., 2005; Elkins et al., 2019). Unfortunately, some of the approaches published since 1990 lacked publicly available tools that would permit others to directly apply the authors’ methods, and while the more simplified and incremental approaches remain appropriate for asking and approaching some questions, they are insufficient for other applications that require more complex approaches (e.g., two-lithology melting; Elkins et al., 2019). Other tools like UserCalc that were available to public users (Spiegelman, 2000) were limited in application and have since become unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the need for more broadly accessible and flexible solutions to U-series disequilibrium problems in partial melting, here we present a cloud-server hosted, publicly available numerical calculator for one-dimensional, decompression partial melting. The tool is provided in a Jupyter notebook with importable Python code and can be accessed from a web browser. Users will be able to access and use the tool using a free cloud server account, or on their own computer given any standard Python distribution. As shown below, the notebook is structured to permit the user to select one of two primary model versions, either classical reactive porous flow after Spiegelman and Elliott (1993) and Spiegelman (2000), or a new disequilibrium transport model, developed after the appendix formulas of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). The new model ranges from pure disequilibrium porous flow transport (i.e., the mass-conserved equivalent of true fractional melting over time) to a \"scaled\" disequilibrium scenario, where the degree of chemical equilibrium that is reached is determined by the relationship between the rate of chemical reaction and the solid decompression rate (which is, in turn, related to the overall melting rate), in the form of a Damköhler number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scaled disequilibrium model resembles the classic dynamic melting model of McKenzie (1985), with the caveat that ours is the first U-series melting model developed for near-fractional, disequilibrium transport where mass is also conserved within a one-dimensional melting regime. That is, rather than controlling the quantity of melt that remains in equilibrium with the solid using a fixed residual porosity, the melt porosity is controlled by Darcy's Law and mass conservation constraints after Spiegelman and Elliott (1993), and the \"near-fractional\" scenario is simulated using the reaction rate of the migrating liquid with the upwelling solid matrix."

    "### 2.3. Solving for transport with chemical reactivity rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The two models described above are end members for complete equilibrium and complete disequilibrium transport. For stable trace elements, these models produce melt compositions that are equivalent to batch melting and accumulated fractional melting (e.g., Spiegelman and Elliott, 1993). However, the actual transport of a reactive fluid (like a melt) through a solid matrix can fall anywhere between these end members depending on the rate of transport and re-equilibration between melt and solid, which can be sensitive to the mesoscopic geometry of melt and solid (e.g., Spiegelman and Kenyon, 1992). In an intermediate scenario, we envision that some reaction occurs, but chemical equilibration is incomplete due to slow reaction rates relative to the differential transport rates for the fluid and solid. If reaction times are sufficiently rapid to achieve chemical exchange over the lengthscale of interest before the liquid segregates, chemical equilibrium can be achieved; but for reactions that occur more slowly than effective transport rates, only partial chemical equilibrium can occur (e.g., Grose and Afonso, 2019; Iwamori, 1993, 1994; Kogiso et al., 2004; Liang and Liu, 2016; Peate and Hawkesworth, 2005; Qin et al., 1992; Yang et al., 2000). Such reaction rates can include, for example, the rate of chemical migration over the distance between high porosity veins or channels (e.g., Aharonov et al., 1995; Jull et al., 2002; Spiegelman et al., 2001; Stracke and Bourdon, 2009); or, at the grain scale, the solid chemical diffusivity of elements over the diameter of individual mineral grains (e.g., Qin et al., 1992, Feineman and DePaolo, 2003; Grose and Afonso, 2019; Oliveira et al., 2020; Van Orman et al., 2002a, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this reactive transport scenario, we start with our equations for disequilibrium transport in a steady-state, one-dimensional conservative system, and add a chemical back-reaction term that permits exchange of elements between the fluid and the solid. The reaction term is scaled by a reactivity rate factor, $\\Re$ and expressed in kg/m$^3$/yr. (i.e., the same units as the melting rate). The reactivity rate thus behaves much like the melting rate by governing the rate of exchange between the solid and liquid phases, effectively scaling the degree to which chemical exchange can occur. This new term could simulate a number of plausible scenarios that would physically limit the rate of chemical exchange by transport along a given distance in a linear manner, such as the movement or diffusion of nuclides through the porous solid matrix between melt channels a given distance apart.\n",

    "#### 3.2.5. Considering lithospheric transport scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "In mantle decompression melting scenarios, melting is expected to cease in the shallow, colder part of the regime where a lithospheric layer is present. The effects of cessation of melting prior to reaching the surface can be envisioned as affecting magma compositions in a number of ways, some of which could be calculated using the models presented here by setting $dF=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, several limitations when using our transport models to simulate lithospheric melt transport in this way, as the model equations are written to track steady-state decompression and melting. The first limitation is thus the underlying assumption that the solid is migrating and experiencing progressive melt depletion in the model, while the solid lithosphere should in fact behave as a rigid matrix that does not experiencing upwelling. For the disequilibrium transport model with $Da=0$, no chemical reequilibration occurs while $dF=0$, so the lack of solid migration after the cessation of melting does not pose a problem; instead, in the pure disequilibrium transport case, imposing $dF=0$ simply allows for radioactive decay and ingrowth during transport through the lithospheric layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium transport model, on the other hand, permits full equilibration even if $dF=0$, but the liquid composition does not directly depend on the solid concentration, $c_i^s(z)$, so ongoing chemical reequilibration between the liquid and a modified lithospheric solid could be simulated by modifying the bulk solid/liquid partition coefficients $D_i$. However, the underlying model assumes that the liquid with mass proportion $F_{max}$ reequilibrates with the solid matrix in a steady-state transport regime, at the maximum reference porosity, which may not accurately simulate the transport regime through the fixed lithosphere with no melting. Because it does not directly consider mineral abundances or compositions, the model also does not account for complexities such as low temperature melt-rock reaction or mineral growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of the scaled disequilibrium transport model with $Da>0$ is the most complex, since the model directly calculates reequilibration of the liquid with a progressively melting solid layer, and thus may not accurately simulate transport through the fixed solid lithosphere. We advise that if the model is used in this way, the results must be interpreted with additional caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, calculating a given transport model through the upwelling asthenosphere and into a fixed overlying lithospheric layer neglects an additional, significant limitation: namely that melt-rock interactions, and thus the magma transport style, may be different in the lithosphere than in the melting asthenosphere. As noted above, this could also include low-temperature reactions and the growth of new mineral phases. While it is not possible to change transport models during a single 1D run in the current implementation, one alternative approach is to change the relative permeability, $K_r$, in the lithosphere, in addition to modifying the bulk partition coefficients to reflect lithospheric values. It may also be possible to run a separate, second-stage lithospheric calculation with modified input parameters and revised liquid porosity constraints, but this option is not currently implemented and would require an expansion of the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these caveats, there are some limited scenarios where users may wish to simulate equilibrium or disequilibrium magma transport through a capping layer with constant $dF=0$, constant $\\phi = \\phi_0$, and revised $D_i$ values for a modified layer mineralogy. The cells below provide options for modifying the existing input data table to impose such a layer. The first cell identifies a final melting pressure $P_{Lithos}$, which is defined by the user in kbar. This value can be set to 0.0 if no lithospheric cap is desired; in the example below, it has been set at 5.0 kbar. There are two overall options for how this final melting pressure could be used to modify the input data. One option (implemented in the Supplementary Materials but not tested here) simply deletes all lines in the input dataframe for depths shallower than $P_{Lithos}$. This is a straightforward option for a one-dimensional column scenario, where melting simply stops at the base of the lithosphere and the composition of the melt product is observed in that position. This is an effective way to limit further chemical interactions after melting has ceased; it fails to account for additional radioactive decay during lithospheric melt transport, but subsequent isotopic decay over a fixed transport time interval could then be calculated using the radioactive decay equations for U-series nuclides.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second option, shown here to demonstrate outcomes, changes the degree of melting increments ($dF$) to a value of 0 for all depths shallower than $P_{Lithos}$, but allows model calculations to continue at shallower depths. This is preferable if the user aims to track additional radioactive decay and/or chemical exchange after melting has ceased and during subsequent transport through the lithospheric layer, and shall be explored further below."

    "We present pyUserCalc, an expanded, publicly available, open-source version of the UserCalc code for determining U-series disequilibria generated in basalts by one-dimensional, decompression partial melting. The model has been developed from conservation of mass equations with two-phase (solid and liquid) porous flow and permeability governed by Darcy's Law. The model reproduces the functionality of the original UserCalc equilibrium porous flow calculator (Spiegelman, 2000) in pure Python code, and implements a new disequilibrium transport model. The disequilibrium transport code includes reactivity rate-limited chemical equilibration calculations controlled by a Damköhler number, $Da$. For stable elements with decay constants equal to zero, the equilibrium model reduces to batch melting and the disequilibrium transport model with $Da$ = 0 to pure fractional melting. The method presented here can be extended to other applications in geochemical porous flow calculations in future work."

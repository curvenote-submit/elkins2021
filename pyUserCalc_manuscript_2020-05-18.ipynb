    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful analysis of uranium-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas relies on the use of complex forward numerical models like dynamic melting (McKenzie, 1985) and equilibrium porous flow (Spiegelman and Elliott, 1993). Historically, such models have either been solved analytically for simplified scenarios, such as constant melting rate or constant solid/melt trace element partitioning throughout the melting process, or have relied on incremental or numerical calculators with limited power to solve problems and/or restricted availability. The most public numerical solution to reactive porous flow, UserCalc (Spiegelman, 2000) was maintained on a private institutional server for nearly two decades, but that approach has been unsustainable in light of modern security concerns. Here we present a more long-lasting solution to the problems of availability, model sophistication and flexibility, and long-term access in the form of a cloud-hosted, publicly available Jupyter notebook. Similar to UserCalc, the new notebook calculates U-series disequilibria during time-dependent, equilibrium partial melting in a one-dimensional porous flow regime where mass is conserved. We further include a mass-conserved, porous flow model where chemical equilibrium is not achieved during transport, ranging from perfect chemical disequilibrium that simulates true fractional melt extraction, to partial chemical equilibration in the transport regime. In the latter model, the chemical reactivity rate scales with the solid decompression rate using a Damköhler number, simulating scenarios such as rate-limiting solid diffusivity of U-series elements."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-dependent forward melting models are necessary to interpret the origins of empirically-measured U-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas, but the limited and unreliable availability of reproducible tools for making such calculations remains a persistent problem for geochemists. To date, number of models have been developed for this task, including classical dynamic melting after McKenzie (1985) and the reactive porous flow model of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). There have since been numerous approaches to using both the dynamic and porous flow models that range from simplified analytical solutions (e.g., Sims et al., 1999; Zou, 1998; Zou and Zindler, 2000) to incremental dynamic melting calculators (Stracke et al., 2003), two-porosity calculators (Jull et al., 2002; Lundstrom, 2000; Sims et al., 2002), and one-dimensional numerical solutions to reactive porous flow (Spiegelman, 2000) and dynamic melting (Bourdon et al., 2005; Elkins et al., 2019). Unfortunately, some of the approaches published since 1990 lacked publicly available tools that would permit others to directly apply the authors’ methods, and while the more simplified and incremental approaches remain appropriate for asking and approaching some questions, they are insufficient for other applications that require more complex approaches (e.g., two-lithology melting; Elkins et al., 2019). Other tools like UserCalc that were available to public users (Spiegelman, 2000) were limited in application and have since become unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the need for more broadly accessible and flexible solutions to U-series disequilibrium problems in partial melting, here we present a cloud-server hosted, publicly available numerical calculator for one-dimensional, decompression partial melting. The tool is provided in a Jupyter notebook with underlying Python coding and can be accessed from a web browser. Users will be able to access and use the tool using a free cloud server account. As shown below, the notebook is structured to permit the user to select one of two primary model versions, either classical reactive porous flow after Spiegelman and Elliott (1993) and Spiegelman (2000), or a new disequilibrium transport model, developed after the appendix formulas of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). The new model ranges from pure disequilibrium porous flow transport (i.e., the mass-conserved equivalent of true fractional melting over time) to a \"scaled\" disequilibrium scenario, where the degree of chemical equilibrium that is reached is determined by the relationship between the rate of chemical reaction compared to the solid decompression rate (which is related to the overall melting rate), in the form of a Damköhler number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scaled disequilibrium model resembles the classic dynamic melting model of McKenzie (1985), with the caveat that ours is the first U-series melting model developed for near-fractional, disequilibrium transport where mass is also conserved within a one-dimensional melting regime. That is, rather than controlling the quantity of melt that remains in equilibrium with the solid using a fixed residual porosity, the melt porosity is controlled by Darcy's Law and mass conservation constraints after Spiegelman and Elliott (1993), and the \"near-fractional\" scenario is simulated using the reaction rate of the migrating liquid with the upwelling solid matrix."

    "\n",
    "The UserCalc model of Spiegelman (2000) formulated a one-dimensional numerical integration for the concentrations of selected U-series isotopes in continuously produced partial melts, after the equilibrium formulas of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). Our model implementation reproduces and builds on that prior effort. The porous flow model calculates the concentrations and activities of U-series isotopes with appropriate half-lives for the study of partial melting and melt transport processes during adiabatic mantle decompression, namely $^{238}$U, $^{230}$Th, $^{226}$Ra, $^{235}$U, and $^{231}$Pa. The equilibrium model of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993) assumes continuous full chemical equilibrium is achieved between the migrating partial melt and the solid rock matrix along a decompressing one-dimensional column, and relies on conservation of mass for each element with a simplified Darcy’s Law expression to govern melt migration by permeable flow.

    "\n",
    "While the pure chemical disequilibrium transport scenario offers an end member model for useful comparison with pure equilibrium flow, actual transport of a reactive fluid (like a melt) through a solid matrix is likely to fall between those extremes. In the intermediate scenario, we envision that some reaction occurs, but chemical equilibration is incomplete due to slow reaction rates relative to the differential transport rates for the fluid and solid. If reaction times are sufficiently rapid to achieve chemical exchange over the lengthscale of interest before the liquid segregates, chemical equilibrium can be achieved; but for reactions that occur more slowly than effective transport rates, something less than full equilibrium is achieved. Such reaction rates can include, for example, chemical migration over the distance between high porosity veins or channels; or, at the grain scale, solid chemical diffusivity of elements over the diameter of individual mineral grains. Depending on the questions being asked and the scenario to be tested, the reactivity rate may vary with the minerals present and from one element to another. (Add REFS above)\n",

    "The log concentration equations provided above are differential equations that can be solved using one of the numerical integration solver tools included in Python software packages. Because the disequilibrium transport model can produce highly variable and very large changes in isotopic concentration in the partial melt over very small increments, a “stiff” numerical solver is highly recommended; the fully implicit Radau method is used as the default in our code and is our recommended approach. Below, the calculator tool is provided as a web-enabled Jupyter notebook that can be implemented by the reader to view the model outcomes and figures; a more compact notebook version is available for online use through the free ENKI cloud portal and code repository and is included here in the supplementary materials. The pyUserCalc Jupyter notebook determines the log concentration of each nuclide throughout a one-dimensional decompression melting scenario, and then calculates the activities of those nuclides. In addition to a series of input and output figures showing variables vs. depth, porosity and solid upwelling contoured plots, and a data table download tool, which resemble outputs of the previous UserCalc incarnation, this new effort additionally generates results for batch operations across a range of upwelling rates and porosities of interest, and produces downloadable data tables and activity ratio vs. activity ratio “mesh” plots.\n",

    "We present an expanded, publicly available, open-source version of the UserCalc code, for determining U-series disequilibria generated in basalts by one-dimensional, decompression partial melting. The model has been developed from conservation of mass equations with two-phase (solid and liquid) porous flow with permeability governed by Darcy's Law. The calculator further implements a full range of time-dependent, chemical transport scenarios: full chemical equilibrium, full chemical disequilibrium, and reactivity rate-limited chemical equilibration controlled by a Damköhler number."

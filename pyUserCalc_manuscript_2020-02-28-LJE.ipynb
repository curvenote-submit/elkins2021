    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful analysis of uranium-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas relies on the use of complex forward numerical models like dynamic melting (McKenzie, 1985) and equilibrium porous flow (Spiegelman and Elliott, 1993). Historically, such models have either been solved analytically by considering only simplified scenarios such as constant melting rate or constant solid/melt trace element partitioning throughout the melting process, or have relied on incremental or numerical calculators with limited power to solve problems and/or restricted availability. The most public numerical solution to reactive porous flow, UserCalc (Spiegelman, 2000) was maintained on a private institutional server for nearly two decades, but that approach has been unsustainable in light of modern security concerns. Here we present a more long-lasting solution to the problems of availability, model sophistication and flexibility, and long-term access in the form of a cloud-hosted, publicly available Jupyter notebook for calculating time-dependent partial melting with both pure equilibrium and pure disequilibrium melt transport scenarios through a one-dimensional porous flow regime."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for time-dependent melting model calculations to interpret the origins of empirically measured U-series isotopic disequilibria in basaltic lavas is well established (e.g., REFS), but the limited and unreliable availability of reproducible tools for making such calculations remains a problem for geochemists. A number of models have been developed for this task, including classical dynamic melting after McKenzie (1985) and the reactive porous flow model of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). There have since been numerous approaches to using both the dynamic and porous flow models that range from simplified analytical solutions (e.g., Zou, Zou and Zindler, Sims 1999, others) to incremental dynamic melting calculators (Stracke et al., 2003), two-porosity calculators (Lundstrom et al., Jull et al., 2002), and one-dimensional numerical solutions to reactive porous flow (Spiegelman, 2000) and dynamic melting (Bourdon et al., 2005; Elkins et al., 2019). Unfortunately, many of the approaches published since 1990 lacked publicly available tools that would permit others to directly reproduce the authors’ results, and while some of the simplified and incremental approaches remain appropriate for asking and approaching specific questions, they are unsufficient for many current applications that require more complex model use (e.g., two-lithology melting; Elkins et al., 2019). Other tools like UserCalc that were freely available to public users (Spiegelman, 2000) were limited in application and have since become in accessible, due to host server updates in the changing security landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the need for more broadly accessible and flexible solutions to U-series disequilibrium problems in partial melting, here we present a cloud-server hosted, publicly available numerical calculator for one-dimensional, decompression partial melting. The tool is provided in a Jupyter notebook with underlying Python coding and that can be run in a browser software window. Users are able to access the tool using a free cloud server account, which permits them to save a copy of the notebook and modify it for their own model calculation needs. As shown below, the notebook is structured to permit the user to select one of two model versions, including classical reactive porous flow after Spiegelman and Elliott (1993) and Spiegelman (2000), as well as a pure disequilibrium transport model, based on the appendix formulas of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). The numerical integration approach and key formulas are summarized below, and are available in greater detail in the above references."

    "## 2. One-dimensional numerical integration of U-series in basalts\n",
    "\n",
    "The UserCalc model of Spiegelman (2000) formulated a one-dimensional numerical integration for the concentrations of selected U-series isotopes in continuously produced partial melts, after the equilibrium formulas of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993). Our model implementation reproduces and builds on those prior efforts. All of the porous flow models calculate the concentrations and activities of U-series isotopes with appropriate half-lives for the study of partial melting and melt transport processes during adiabatic mantle decompression, namely 238U, 230Th, 226Ra, 235U, and 231Pa. The equilibrium model assumes continuous full chemical equilibrium is achieved between the migrating partial melt and the solid rock matrix along a decompressing one-dimensional column, and relies on conservation of mass for each element with a simplified Darcy’s Law expression to govern melt migration. The concentration expression derived by Spiegelman (2000) for this equilibrium scenario (formula 6 in that reference) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "..\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiegelman (2000) further observed that solving for the natural log of the concentrations, rather than the concentrations themselves, is a more “tractable” integration approach for a numerical solver (formulas 7-9 of that article):\n",
    "\n",
    "..\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Spiegelman (2000) defined a series of additional variables that allow for simpler integration formulas and aid in efficient solution of the model, namely (list with definitions here: rho_bar, F_bar, R_i/i-1, alpha, w_eff, rhoD_bar, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactive porous flow calculation thus relies on both user inputs for F(z) and Di(z), as well as a formula for migrating melt porosity (phi(z) that uses a Darcy’s law expression and scaled permeability factor: (add briefly here).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reproducing the above effort using more modern and readily accessible computer language (Python instead of FORTRAN) and platform (Jupyter notebooks), here we present an additional calculation tool that solves a similar set of equations for pure chemical disequilibrium  transport during one-dimensional decompression melting. The model solves for the concentration of each nuclide using equations 26-27 of Spiegelman and Elliott (1993):\n",
    "\n",
    "..\n",
    "\n",
    "which maintain conservation of mass but act as a more general set of expressions that no longer require full chemical equilibrium to be reached. The modified log concentration expressions for disequilibrium transport are thus:\n",

    "The log concentration equations provided above are differential equations that can be solved using one of the many numerical integration solver tools included in Python software packages. Because the disequilibrium transport model can produce highly variable and very large changes in isotopic concentration in the partial melt over very small increments (i.e., it is a very stiff model), a “stiff” numerical solver such as Radau is highly recommended and is used as the default in our code. Below, the basic tool is provided as a web-enabled notebook that can be implemented by the reader to view the model outcomes and figures; a more complete version is available for online use through the free ENKI cloud portal, as detailed in the supporting information. The notebook determines the log concentration of each nuclide throughout a one-dimensional decompression melting scenario, and then calculates the activity of each nuclide for the same scenario. In addition to variable vs. depth input and output figures, porosity and solid upwelling contour plots, and a data table download tool, which resemble outputs of the previous UserCalc incarnation, this new effort also generates data tables over a range of upwelling rates and porosities of interest, plus activity ratio vs. activity ratio “mesh” plots as editable postscript files.\n",
